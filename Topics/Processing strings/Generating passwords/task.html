<h2>Generating passwords</h2>
<p>A password is hard to crack if it contains at least A uppercase letters, at least B lowercase letters, at least C digits and consists of exactly N symbols. Also, a password cannot contain two or more of the same characters in a row.</p>

<p>For the given numbers A, B, C, and N, you should output a password that matches these requirements.<br>
<br>
It is guaranteed that A, B, C, and N are non-negative integers, and A + B + C &lt;= N. Keep in mind that any parameter can be equal to zero. It means that it's ok if the password doesn't contain symbols of such type.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">3 2 3 10</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">ABAab121AB</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
