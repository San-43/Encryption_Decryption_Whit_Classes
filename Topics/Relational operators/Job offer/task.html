<h2>Job offer</h2>
<html><body><p>You would like to offer a job as a Java developer for several candidates.</p>
<p>Your company has a special rule written in Java for decision-making.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean offerAJob = 
        (knowJava &amp;&amp; yearsOfExperienceInJava &gt;= 1) || 
        (knowPython &amp;&amp; yearsOfExperienceInPython &gt;= 3);</code></pre>
<p>A small explanation:</p>
<p><strong>- knowJava</strong> is a boolean variable that shows whether the candidate knows Java or not.</p>
<p><strong>- knowPython</strong> is a boolean variable that shows whether the candidate knows Python or not.</p>
<p><strong>- yearsOfExperienceInJava</strong> is an <code class="language-java">int</code> variable that shows how many years of Java programming the candidate has.</p>
<p><strong>- yearsOfExperienceInPython</strong> is another <code class="language-java">int</code> variable that shows how many years of Python programming the candidate has.</p>
<p>The list of candidates with their skills is the following:</p>
<p>- <strong>John:</strong> knowJava = true; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 1; knowPython = false; yearsOfExperienceInPython = 0;</p>
<p>- <strong>Mary:</strong> knowJava = false; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 0; knowPython = true; yearsOfExperienceInPython = 3;</p>
<p>- <strong>Olivia:</strong> knowJava = true; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 0; knowPython = true; yearsOfExperienceInPython = 2;</p>
<p>- <strong>Alexander: </strong>knowJava = true; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 3; knowPython = true; yearsOfExperienceInPython = 2;</p>
<p>- <strong>Andrew:</strong> knowJava = false; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 1; knowPython = false; yearsOfExperienceInPython = 1;</p>
<p>- <strong>Emily:</strong> knowJava = false; yearsOfExperienceInJava = 0; knowPython = true; yearsOfExperienceInPython = 2;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Using a decision-making rule, select all candidates that will be good for your company.</strong></p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Note, sometimes a candidate may have the experience, but still knows the programming language badly. In this case, we consider their knowledge as false.</div><p></p></body></html>
