<h2>Greatest common divisor</h2>
<html><body><p>The following method implements an algorithm to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor">the greatest common divisor</a> (GCD) of two positive numbers.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b &gt; 0) {
        int c = a % b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return a;
}</code></pre>
<p>Now it does not matter if you know the GCD. Try to execute this algorithm yourself and select all the correct results produced by the algorithm.</p></body></html>
