<p>You were asked to help with Java programming in a company that makes boxes. Their former Java programmer created Box class that uses objects and requires casting. Now everyone knows that casting is <a target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2076555/build-ci-sdlc/java-performance-programming--part-2--the-cost-of-casting.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: http://www.javaworld.com/article/2076555/build-ci-sdlc/java-performance-programming--part-2--the-cost-of-casting.html">slow</a> and error-prone and that is why the programmer got fired.
